# Women Who Code Manila

## Android App Development Study Group

For beginners, we will learn the basic concepts of
programming using Java and Kotlin.

For intermediate/advanced Android developers, let's share the knowledge and build apps together!

board](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Manila/messages/boards/forum/24291952).
